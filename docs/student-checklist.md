# Grey Team Competition Build Checklist

This checklist guides you through building your competition infrastructure. Work through each section in order. Do not skip steps.

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md).

---

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

Complete these steps before writing any code.

### 1.1 Install Required Software

Run each command to verify the tool is installed. If a command fails, install the tool before continuing.

```bash
# Check Git
git --version

# Check OpenTofu
tofu version

# Check Ansible
ansible --version

# Check Python
python3 --version
```

- [ ] Git installed and working
- [ ] OpenTofu installed and working
- [ ] Ansible installed and working
- [ ] Python 3 installed and working

### 1.2 Create SSH Key

Windows servers require RSA keys. Check if you have one:

```bash
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
```

If no files appear, create a key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

- [ ] RSA SSH key pair exists at ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

### 1.3 Record Your Project Names

Your instructor will provide names for three OpenStack projects:

| Project | Name | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Main | ________________ | Grey Team (network, scoring) |
| Blue | ________________ | Blue Team (Windows, Linux defenders) |
| Red | ________________ | Red Team (Kali attackers) |

- [ ] Main project name recorded
- [ ] Blue project name recorded
- [ ] Red project name recorded

### 1.4 Configure OpenStack Access

1. Go to https://openstack.cyberrange.rit.edu
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to Compute, then Key Pairs
4. Click Import Public Key
5. Enter a name for your key (write it down)
6. Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and paste the output
7. Click Import Public Key

- [ ] SSH public key uploaded to OpenStack
- [ ] Key name recorded: ________________

### 1.5 Get Your Project IDs

For each of your three projects, find the Project ID:

1. In OpenStack, click the project dropdown (top left)
2. Select your main project
3. Go to Identity, then Projects
4. Find your project and copy the Project ID

| Project | ID |
|---------|-----|
| Main | ________________________________ |
| Blue | ________________________________ |
| Red | ________________________________ |

- [ ] Main project ID recorded
- [ ] Blue project ID recorded
- [ ] Red project ID recorded

### 1.6 Create Application Credentials

1. In OpenStack, make sure your **main project** is selected
2. Navigate to Identity, then Application Credentials
3. Click Create Application Credential
4. Enter a name (like "grey-team")
5. Click Create Application Credential
6. Click Download openrc file
7. Save the file - the secret is only shown once

- [ ] Application credentials created (in main project)
- [ ] openrc file downloaded

### 1.7 Set Up This Project

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cdt-automation

# Move your credentials file here
mv ~/Downloads/app-cred-*-openrc.sh .

# Run setup script
./quick-start.sh
```

- [ ] Project cloned
- [ ] Credentials file in project directory
- [ ] quick-start.sh ran successfully

### 1.8 Configure Project IDs and SSH Key

Edit `opentofu/variables.tf` and replace the `CHANGEME-*` placeholders with your values:

- `keypair` - your SSH key name from step 1.4 (replace `CHANGEME-YourKeypairName`)
- `main_project_id` - your main project ID from step 1.5 (replace `CHANGEME-main-project-id`)
- `blue_project_id` - your blue project ID from step 1.5 (replace `CHANGEME-blue-project-id`)
- `red_project_id` - your red project ID from step 1.5 (replace `CHANGEME-red-project-id`)

- [ ] keypair variable updated
- [ ] main_project_id variable updated
- [ ] blue_project_id variable updated
- [ ] red_project_id variable updated

### 1.9 Verify Setup

```bash
# Load credentials
source app-cred-openrc.sh

# Initialize OpenTofu
cd opentofu
tofu init

# Verify OpenTofu can connect to OpenStack
tofu plan
```

If `tofu plan` shows resources it would create without errors, your setup is complete. You should see resources being created in all three projects.

- [ ] `source app-cred-openrc.sh` runs without errors
- [ ] `tofu init` completes successfully
- [ ] `tofu plan` shows resources in main, blue, and red projects
- [ ] No authentication or project ID errors

---

## Phase 2: Design Your Competition

Complete your design on paper before writing code. Changing your design after building infrastructure wastes time.

**Note:** The template provides base infrastructure:
- Network with RBAC sharing across three projects
- Scoring server(s) in main project
- Windows DC and members in blue project
- Linux servers in blue project
- Kali attack boxes in red project

Your design extends this foundation with additional servers, services, and network segments.

### 2.1 Network Design

Draw your network topology. Your competition must have:

- [ ] Remote/DMZ network segment (publicly accessible services)
- [ ] Local/Internal network segment (internal services)
- [ ] Router or firewall between segments
- [ ] Management network (for Grey Team monitoring)
- [ ] Red Team network (isolated attack infrastructure)

Write down your IP addressing scheme:

| Network | CIDR | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| DMZ | ___.___.___.___/___ | ________________ |
| Internal | ___.___.___.___/___ | ________________ |
| Management | ___.___.___.___/___ | ________________ |
| Red Team | ___.___.___.___/___ | ________________ |

- [ ] Network topology drawn
- [ ] IP addressing scheme documented

### 2.2 System Inventory

List every system your competition needs. Remember:

- Every Blue Team member needs a dedicated workstation
- Every Red Team member needs a dedicated workstation
- You need at least 2 Windows systems
- You need at least 3 Linux systems
- You need at least 5 scored services

Fill in your system inventory:

| Hostname | IP Address | OS | Purpose | Scored? |
|----------|------------|----|---------|---------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

(Add more rows as needed)

- [ ] All servers listed with hostnames and IPs
- [ ] At least 2 Windows systems included
- [ ] At least 3 Linux systems included
- [ ] Blue Team workstations included (one per member)
- [ ] Red Team workstations included (one per member)
- [ ] Scored services identified

### 2.3 Scored Services

List every service that will be scored:

| Service Name | Host | Port | Check Method | Points |
|--------------|------|------|--------------|--------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

- [ ] At least 5 scored services defined
- [ ] Check method documented for each service
- [ ] Point values assigned

### 2.4 Credentials

Plan your credentials. Document them now so you do not forget:

| System/Service | Username | Password | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|----------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

- [ ] All credentials documented
- [ ] Credentials stored securely

---

## Phase 3: Build Infrastructure with OpenTofu

Now translate your design into OpenTofu configuration.

**Important:** This project uses three OpenStack provider aliases:
- `openstack.main` - Main/Grey Team project (network, scoring)
- `openstack.blue` - Blue Team project (defensive servers)
- `openstack.red` - Red Team project (Kali attack boxes)

When adding resources, specify which project should own them using the `provider` attribute.

### 3.1 Create Network Resources

Edit `opentofu/network.tf` to add your network segments.

For each network in your design (networks should be in the main project):

```hcl
resource "openstack_networking_network_v2" "NETWORK_NAME" {
  provider       = openstack.main
  name           = "competition-NETWORK_NAME"
  admin_state_up = true
}

resource "openstack_networking_subnet_v2" "NETWORK_NAME_subnet" {
  provider        = openstack.main
  name            = "competition-NETWORK_NAME-subnet"
  network_id      = openstack_networking_network_v2.NETWORK_NAME.id
  cidr            = "YOUR.CIDR.HERE/24"
  ip_version      = 4
  dns_nameservers = ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
}
```

- [ ] DMZ network resource created (with provider = openstack.main)
- [ ] Internal network resource created
- [ ] Management network resource created
- [ ] RBAC policies added to share new networks with blue/red projects
- [ ] Router/firewall resource created (if using pfSense or similar)

### 3.2 Create Instance Resources

Edit the appropriate `opentofu/instances-*.tf` file (or copy one to create a new VM type).

For each server type, add a resource block. Use the existing resources as templates. Specify the correct provider for each team:

```hcl
# Blue Team servers use openstack.blue
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "blue_webserver" {
  provider = openstack.blue
  # ...
}

# Red Team servers use openstack.red
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "red_additional" {
  provider = openstack.red
  # ...
}

# Scoring/Grey Team servers use openstack.main
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "scoring_additional" {
  provider = openstack.main
  # ...
}
```

- [ ] Scored service servers added (with provider = openstack.blue)
- [ ] Additional Blue Team servers added (with provider = openstack.blue)
- [ ] Additional Red Team servers added (with provider = openstack.red)
- [ ] Additional scoring servers added (with provider = openstack.main)

### 3.3 Create Variables

Edit `opentofu/variables.tf` to add variables for configurable values:

- [ ] Server count variables added
- [ ] Network CIDR variables added
- [ ] Image name variables added
- [ ] Any team-size variables added

### 3.4 Create Outputs

Edit `opentofu/outputs.tf` to output IP addresses for all your servers:

- [ ] Outputs added for all server types
- [ ] Outputs include both internal and floating IPs

### 3.5 Test OpenTofu Configuration

```bash
source app-cred-openrc.sh
cd opentofu
tofu plan
```

Review the plan output carefully. Verify:

- [ ] All expected networks will be created
- [ ] All expected servers will be created
- [ ] IP addresses match your design
- [ ] No errors in the plan output

### 3.6 Deploy Infrastructure

When the plan looks correct:

```bash
tofu apply
```

Type `yes` to confirm.

- [ ] `tofu apply` completed successfully
- [ ] All resources created in OpenStack dashboard

### 3.7 Record Outputs

```bash
tofu output
```

Copy and save this information. You will need it for Ansible and documentation.

- [ ] All IP addresses recorded

---

## Phase 4: Update Inventory Script

The `import-tofu-to-ansible.py` script must be updated to include your new server types.

### 4.1 Understand the Script

Read through `import-tofu-to-ansible.py` to understand how it works:

1. It runs `tofu output -json` to get server information
2. It parses the JSON to extract hostnames and IPs organized by team
3. It writes an Ansible inventory file with groups and variables

The script generates these groups by default:

| Group | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `scoring` | Grey Team scoring servers |
| `windows_dc` | First Blue Windows server |
| `blue_windows_members` | Other Blue Windows servers |
| `blue_linux_members` | Blue Linux servers |
| `red_team` | Red Team Kali boxes |

Plus hierarchy groups: `windows`, `blue_team`, `linux_members`

- [ ] Script logic understood
- [ ] Output structure understood

### 4.2 Add Your Server Types

Edit the script to include inventory groups for your new server types. Follow the patterns used for existing groups.

For each new server type:
1. Add output in `outputs.tf` with names and IPs
2. Add code in the script to extract from the new output
3. Add a new inventory group section
4. Add appropriate connection variables
5. Add to hierarchy groups if needed

- [ ] New outputs added to outputs.tf
- [ ] DMZ servers added to inventory script
- [ ] Additional Blue Team servers added to inventory script
- [ ] Additional Red Team servers added to inventory script
- [ ] Any other server types added
- [ ] Hierarchy groups updated if needed

### 4.3 Test Inventory Generation

```bash
python3 import-tofu-to-ansible.py
cat ansible/inventory/production.ini
```

Verify the inventory file contains:
- [ ] All servers with correct IPs
- [ ] Servers in correct team groups
- [ ] Servers in correct hierarchy groups
- [ ] Connection variables for each group

---

## Phase 5: Build Ansible Configuration

Now create Ansible playbooks and roles to configure your servers.

### 5.1 Create Role Directory Structure

For each service type, create a role:

```bash
# Example for a web server role
mkdir -p ansible/roles/webserver/{tasks,handlers,templates,defaults,files}
```

- [ ] Role directories created for each service type

### 5.2 Write Role Tasks

For each role, create `tasks/main.yml` with the configuration tasks.

Use the existing roles (domain_controller, linux_domain_member, domain_users) as examples.

- [ ] Tasks written for each role
- [ ] Tasks tested individually

### 5.3 Create Playbooks

For each role, create a playbook in `ansible/playbooks/`:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Service Name
  hosts: your_server_group
  become: true
  roles:
    - your_role_name
```

Use the appropriate team groups:
- `blue_team` - All Blue Team servers
- `blue_linux_members` - Blue Linux only
- `blue_windows_members` - Blue Windows (except DC)
- `windows_dc` - Domain Controller only
- `red_team` - Red Team Kali boxes
- `scoring` - Grey Team scoring servers
- `linux_members` - All Linux servers

**Note:** Red Team Kali boxes should NOT run domain-related playbooks since they do not join the domain.

- [ ] Playbook created for each service
- [ ] Playbooks use correct team/host groups
- [ ] Red Team playbooks do not include domain tasks

### 5.4 Update site.yml

Edit `ansible/playbooks/site.yml` to import your new playbooks:

```yaml
- name: Configure Your Service
  import_playbook: your-playbook.yml
```

Order matters. Put playbooks in the order they should run (dependencies first).

- [ ] All playbooks imported in site.yml
- [ ] Playbooks ordered correctly (dependencies first)

### 5.5 Add Variables

Edit `ansible/group_vars/` files to add variables for your services.

Create new group_vars files for new groups if needed.

- [ ] Variables defined for all services
- [ ] Credentials stored in variables (not hardcoded in tasks)

### 5.6 Test Ansible Playbooks

Run playbooks one at a time to test them:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook playbooks/your-first-playbook.yml -v
```

Fix any errors before running the next playbook.

- [ ] Each playbook tested individually
- [ ] All playbooks run successfully

### 5.7 Test Full Deployment

Run the complete site.yml:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml
```

- [ ] Full site.yml runs without errors
- [ ] All services configured correctly

---

## Phase 6: Build Scoring Engine

Your competition needs automated service checks.

### 6.1 Choose Scoring Approach

Decide how you will implement scoring:

- [ ] Option A: Custom Python scoring engine
- [ ] Option B: Existing tool (ScoreStack, etc.)
- [ ] Option C: Ansible-based checks with logging
- [ ] Option D: Other (specify): ________________

### 6.2 Implement Service Checks

For each scored service, implement a check that:
1. Tests if the service is responding
2. Verifies the service returns expected content
3. Logs the result with timestamp

- [ ] Check implemented for service 1: ________________
- [ ] Check implemented for service 2: ________________
- [ ] Check implemented for service 3: ________________
- [ ] Check implemented for service 4: ________________
- [ ] Check implemented for service 5: ________________

### 6.3 Implement Scoring Logic

- [ ] Points calculation implemented
- [ ] Score storage implemented (database or files)
- [ ] Score display implemented (dashboard or logs)

### 6.4 Automate Check Execution

- [ ] Checks run automatically on schedule
- [ ] Schedule interval matches requirements (every 1-5 minutes)

### 6.5 Test Scoring Engine

- [ ] Scoring engine starts successfully
- [ ] Checks execute on schedule
- [ ] Scores recorded correctly
- [ ] Scores display correctly
